**dismolib** is an interactive library for simulating the numerical outcomes of published mathematical epidemiology models including two types of COVID-19 models!
  
  For a disease model in this library, you can:
  
  <ul>
  <li>Vary the parameters</li>
  <li>Simulate the time course</li>
  <li>Perform stability analysis</li>
  <li>And so much more.. </li>
  </ul>

tab
* Understand the flowchart
* Explore the health states/compartments by clicking on Species
* Explore the parameters by clicking on Global Quantities
* Run a Task like Time Course or Stability Analysis
* Download the model as a COPASI (.cps) or an SBML (.xml) file to make changes
* Read more about each model and its analysis in
